With a focus on use-inspired research and practice, I collaborate closely with industry, communities, government bodies, and third-sector stakeholders to explore the environmental and social impacts of supply chains. I view supply chains as complex social-ecological systems that possess unique capabilities to drive sustainable development. However, I also recognize their susceptibility to significant disruptions and potential harm to the environment and society. To address these challenges, I employ a range of research methodologies in operations research, system dynamics, social sciences, and complexity sciences. My overarching research objective is to understand how to design and operate complex supply chains in order to tackle the significant sustainability challenges we face. I am particularly interested in studying the effects of technological transitions on food, energy, and humanitarian supply chains.

My academic background includes a Ph.D. in Engineering from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), as well as a Certificate in Logistics and Supply Chain Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). During my Ph.D., I also had the opportunity to conduct research at MIT's Sloan School of Management. Prior to this, I completed my M.Sc. in Operations Research and a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering at UFSCar. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have founded two award-winning technology startups in Brazil and a sustainable innovation consultancy in Denmark, while pursuing my Ph.D. These ventures have provided me with invaluable opportunities to translate cutting-edge research into practical applications.
